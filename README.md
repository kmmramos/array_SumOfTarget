# array_SumOfTarget
This is to demonstrate the optimized solution from the normal solution of adding two elements inside an array that produces the target value.

Problem: Given an array of integers, return the indices of the 2 numbers that add up to a given target.
For example: Given this array [1, 3, 7, 9, 2] and the target is 11, the answers shold be indices 3 and 4 because their elements will produce 11 when they add up.
